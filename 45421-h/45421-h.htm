<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">T</span>HE words of lamentation from the old
Moorish ballad, which in boyhood we
used to recite, must, I think, have risen
to many lips when the world was told that
Theodore Roosevelt was dead. But whatever the
phrase the thought was instant and everywhere.
Variously expressed, you heard it in the crowds
about the bulletin boards, from the man in the
street and the man on the railroads, from the
farmer in the fields, the women in the shops, in
the factories, and in the homes. The pulpit
found in his life a text for sermons. The judge
on the bench, the child at school, alike paused for
a moment, conscious of a loss. The cry of sorrow
came from men and women of all conditions, high
and low, rich and poor, from the learned and the
ignorant, from the multitude who had loved and
followed him, and from those who had opposed
and resisted him. The newspapers pushed aside the
absorbing reports of the events of these fateful days
and gave pages to the man who had died. Flashed
beneath the ocean and through the air went the announcement
of his death, and back came a world-wide
response from courts and cabinets, from press
and people, in other and far-distant lands. Through
it all ran a golden thread of personal feeling which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
gleams so rarely in the somber formalism of public
grief. Everywhere the people felt in their hearts
that:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A power was passing from the Earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To breathless Nature&rsquo;s dark abyss.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It would seem that here was a man, a private citizen,
conspicuous by no office, with no glitter of
power about him, no ability to reward or punish,
gone from the earthly life, who must have been unusual
even among the leaders of men, and who thus
demands our serious consideration.</p>

<p>This is a thought to be borne in mind to-day. We
meet to render honor to the dead, to the great American
whom we mourn. But there is something more
to be done. We must remember that when History,
with steady hand and calm eyes, free from the passions
of the past, comes to make up the final account,
she will call as her principal witnesses the
contemporaries of the man or the event awaiting
her verdict. Here and elsewhere the men and women
who knew Theodore Roosevelt or who belong
to his period will give public utterance to their emotions
and to their judgments in regard to him. This
will be part of the record to which the historian will
turn when our living present has become the past,
of which it is his duty to write. Thus is there a responsibility
placed upon each one of us who will
clearly realize that here, too, is a duty to posterity,
whom we would fain guide to the truth as we see it,
and to whose hands we commit our share in the history
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of our beloved country&mdash;that history so much
of which was made under his leadership.</p>

<p>We can not approach Theodore Roosevelt along
the beaten paths of eulogy or satisfy ourselves with
the empty civilities of commonplace funereal tributes,
for he did not make his life journey over main-traveled
roads, nor was he ever commonplace. Cold
and pompous formalities would be unsuited to him
who was devoid of affectation, who was never self-conscious,
and to whom posturing to draw the
public gaze seemed not only repellent but vulgar.
He had that entire simplicity of manners and
modes of life which is the crowning result of the
highest culture and the finest nature. Like Cromwell,
he would always have said: &ldquo;Paint me as I
am.&rdquo; In that spirit, in his spirit of devotion to
truth&rsquo;s simplicity, I shall try to speak of him to-day
in the presence of the representatives of the great
Government of which he was for seven years the
head.</p>

<p>The rise of any man from humble or still more
from sordid beginnings to the heights of success
always and naturally appeals strongly to the imagination.
It furnishes a vivid contrast which is as
much admired as it is readily understood. It still
retains the wonder which such success awakened in
the days of hereditary lawgivers and high privileges
of birth. Birth and fortune, however, mean
much less now than two centuries ago. To climb
from the place of a printer&rsquo;s boy to the highest rank
in science, politics, and diplomacy would be far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
easier to-day than in the eighteenth century, given
a genius like Franklin to do it. Moreover the real
marvel is in the soaring achievement itself, no matter
what the origin of the man who comes by &ldquo;the
people&rsquo;s unbought grace to rule his native land&rdquo;
and who on descending from the official pinnacle
still leads and influences thousands upon thousands
of his fellow men.</p>

<p>Theodore Roosevelt had the good fortune to be
born of a well-known, long-established family,
with every facility for education and with an atmosphere
of patriotism and disinterested service
both to country and humanity all about him. In his
father he had before him an example of lofty public
spirit, from which it would have been difficult to
depart. But if the work of his ancestors relieved
him from the hard struggle which meets an unaided
man at the outset, he also lacked the spur of necessity
to prick the sides of his intent, in itself no small
loss. As a balance to the opportunity which was his
without labor, he had not only the later difficulties
which come to him to whom fate has been kind at
the start; he had also spread before him the temptations
inseparable from such inherited advantages
as fell to his lot&mdash;temptations to a life of sports
and pleasure, to lettered ease, to an amateur&rsquo;s
career in one of the fine arts, perhaps to a money-making
business, likewise an inheritance, none of
them easily to be set aside in obedience to the stern
rule that the larger and more facile the opportunity
the greater and more insistent the responsibility.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
How he refused to tread the pleasant paths that
opened to him on all sides and took the instant way
which led over the rough road of toil and action his
life discloses.</p>

<p>At the beginning, moreover, he had physical difficulties
not lightly to be overcome. He was a delicate
child, suffering acutely from attacks of asthma.
He was not a strong boy, was retiring, fond of books,
and with an intense but solitary devotion to natural
history. As his health gradually improved he became
possessed by the belief, although he perhaps
did not then formulate it, that in the fields of active
life a man could do that which he willed to do; and
this faith was with him to the end. It became very
evident when he went to Harvard. He made himself
an athlete by sheer hard work. Hampered by extreme
near-sightedness, he became none the less a
formidable boxer and an excellent shot. He stood
high in scholarship, but as he worked hard, so he
played hard, and was popular in the university and
beloved by his friends. For a shy and delicate boy
all this meant solid achievement, as well as unusual
determination and force of will. Apparently he
took early to heart and carried out to fulfillment
the noble lines of Clough&rsquo;s <i>Dipsychus</i>:</p>

<p>When a young man comes out of college he descends
suddenly from the highest place in a little
world to a very obscure corner in a great one. It is
something of a shock, and there is apt to be a chill
in the air. Unless the young man&rsquo;s life has been
planned beforehand and a place provided for him
by others, which is exceptional, or unless he is fortunate
in a strong and dominating purpose or talent
which drives him to science or art or some particular
profession, he finds himself at this period pausing
and wondering where he can get a grip upon the
vast and confused world into which he has been
plunged.</p>

<p>It is a trying and only too frequently a disheartening
experience, this looking for a career, this effort
to find employment in a huge and hurrying
crowd which appears to have no use for the new-comer.
Roosevelt, thus cast forth on his own resources&mdash;his
father, so beloved by him, having died two
years before&mdash;fell to work at once, turning to the
study of the law, which he did not like, and to the
completion of a history of the War of 1812 which
he had begun while still in college. With few exceptions,
young beginners in the difficult art of writing
are either too exuberant or too dry. Roosevelt
said that his book was as dry as an encyclopedia,
thus erring in precisely the direction one would not
have expected. The book, be it said, was by no
means so dry as he thought it, and it had some other
admirable qualities. It was clear and thorough, and
the battles by sea and land, especially the former,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
which involved the armaments and crews, the size
and speed of the ships engaged in the famous frigate
and sloop actions, of which we won eleven out
of thirteen, were given with a minute accuracy
never before attempted in the accounts of this war,
and which made the book an authority, a position
it holds to this day.</p>

<p>This was a good deal of sound work for a boy&rsquo;s
first year out of college. But it did not content
Roosevelt. Inherited influences and inborn desires
made him earnest and eager to render some public
service. In pursuit of this aspiration he joined the
Twenty-first Assembly District Republican Association
of the city of New York, for by such machinery
all politics were carried on in those days. It was
not an association composed of his normal friends;
in fact, the members were not only eminently practical
persons but they were inclined to be rough in
their methods. They were not dreamers, nor were
they laboring under many illusions. Roosevelt went
among them a complete stranger. He differed from
them with entire frankness, concealed nothing, and
by his strong and simple democratic ways, his intense
Americanism, and the magical personal attraction
which went with him to the end, made some
devoted friends. One of the younger leaders, &ldquo;Joe&rdquo;
Murray, believed in him, became especially attached
to him, and so continued until death separated
them. Through Murray&rsquo;s efforts he was
elected to the New York Assembly in 1881, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
thus only one year after leaving college his public
career began. He was just twenty-three.</p>

<p>Very few men make an effective State reputation
in their first year in the lower branch of the State
legislature. I never happened to hear of one who
made a national reputation in such a body. Roosevelt
did both. When he left the assembly after three
years' service he was a national figure, well known,
and of real importance, and also a delegate at large
from the great State of New York to the Republican
national convention of 1884, where he played a
leading part. Energy, ability, and the most entire
courage were the secret of his extraordinary success.
It was a time of flagrant corporate influence in
the New York Legislature, of the &ldquo;Black Horse
Cavalry,&rdquo; of a group of members who made money
by sustaining corporation measures or by levying
on corporations and capital through the familiar
artifice of &ldquo;strike bills.&rdquo; Roosevelt attacked them
all openly and aggressively and never silently or
quietly. He fought for the impeachment of a judge
solely because he believed the judge corrupt, which
surprised some of his political associates of both
parties, there being, as one practical thinker observed,
&ldquo;no politics in politics.&rdquo; He failed to secure
the impeachment, but the fight did not fail, nor
did the people forget it; and despite&mdash;perhaps because
of&mdash;the enemies he made, he was twice reelected.
He became at the same time a distinct,
well-defined figure to the American people. He had
touched the popular imagination. In this way he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
performed the unexampled feat of leaving the New
York Assembly, which he had entered three years
before an unknown boy, with a national reputation
and with his name at least known throughout the
United States. He was twenty-six years old.</p>

<p>When he left Chicago at the close of the national
convention in June, 1884, he did not return to New
York, but went West to the Bad Lands of the Little
Missouri Valley, where he had purchased a ranch
in the previous year. The early love of natural history
which never abated had developed into a passion
for hunting and for life in the open. He had
begun in the wilds of Maine and then turned to the
West and to a cattle ranch to gratify both tastes.
The life appealed to him and he came to love it.
He herded and rounded up his cattle, he worked as
a cow-puncher, only rather harder than any of
them, and in the intervals he hunted and shot big
game. He also came in contact with men of a new
type, rough, sometimes dangerous, but always vigorous
and often picturesque. With them he had the
same success as with the practical politicians of the
Twenty-first Assembly District, although they
were widely different specimens of mankind.
But all alike were human at bottom and so
was Roosevelt. He argued with them, rode with
them, camped with them, played and joked with
them, but was always master of his outfit.
They respected him and also liked him, because
he was at all times simple, straightforward,
outspoken, and sincere. He became a popular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and well-known figure in that western country
and was regarded as a good fellow, a &ldquo;white
man,&rdquo; entirely fearless, thoroughly good-natured
and kind, never quarrelsome, and never safe to
trifle with, bully, or threaten. The life and experiences
of that time found their way into a book, <i>The
Hunting Trips of a Ranchman</i>, interesting in description
and adventure and also showing a marked
literary quality.</p>

<p>In 1886 he ran as Republican candidate for
mayor of New York and might have been elected
had his own party stood by him. But many excellent
men of Republican faith&mdash;the &ldquo;timid good,&rdquo; as
he called them&mdash;panic-stricken by the formidable
candidacy of Henry George, flocked to the support
of Mr. Abram Hewitt, the Democratic candidate,
as the man most certain to defeat the menacing
champion of single taxation. Roosevelt was beaten,
but his campaign, which was entirely his own and
the precursor of many others, his speeches with
their striking quality then visible to the country for
the first time, all combined to fix the attention of
the people upon the losing candidate. Roosevelt
was the one of the candidates who was most interesting,
and again he had touched the imagination of
the people and cut a little deeper into the popular
consciousness and memory.</p>

<p>Two years more of private life, devoted to his
home, where his greatest happiness was always
found, to his ranch, to reading and writing books,
and then came an active part in the campaign of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
1888, resulting in the election of President Harrison,
who made him civil-service commissioner in
the spring of 1889. He was in his thirty-first year.
Civil-service reform as a practical question was
then in its initial stages. The law establishing it,
limited in extent and forced through by a few leaders
of both parties in the Senate, was only six years
old. The promoters of the reform, strong in quality,
but weak in numbers, had compelled a reluctant
acceptance of the law by exercising a balance-of-power
vote in certain States and districts. It had
few earnest supporters in Congress, some lukewarm
friends, and many strong opponents. All the
active politicians were practically against it. Mr.
Conkling had said that when Dr. Johnson told Boswell
&ldquo;that patriotism was the last refuge of a scoundrel&rdquo;
he was ignorant of the possibilities of the
word &ldquo;reform,&rdquo; and this witticism met with a large
response.</p>

<p>Civil-service reform, meaning the establishment
of a classified service and the removal of routine
administrative offices from politics, had not reached
the masses of the people at all. The average voter
knew and cared nothing about it. When six years
later Roosevelt resigned from the commission the
great body of the people knew well what civil-service
reform meant, large bodies of voters cared a
great deal about it, and it was established and
spreading its control. We have had many excellent
men who have done good work in the Civil Service
Commission, although that work is neither adventurous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
nor exciting and rarely attracts public attention,
but no one has ever forgotten that Theodore
Roosevelt was once civil-service commissioner.</p>

<p>He found the law struggling for existence,
laughed at, sneered at, surrounded by enemies in
Congress, and with but few fighting friends. He
threw himself into the fray. Congress investigated
the commission about once a year, which was exactly
what Roosevelt desired. Annually, too, the
opponents of the reform would try to defeat the appropriation
for the commission, and this again was
playing into Roosevelt&rsquo;s hands, for it led to debates,
and the newspapers as a rule sustained the reform.
Senator Gorman mourned in the Senate over the
cruel fate of a &ldquo;bright young man&rdquo; who was unable
to tell on examination the distance of Baltimore
from China, and thus was deprived of his inalienable
right to serve his country in the post office.
Roosevelt proved that no such question had ever
been asked and requested the name of the &ldquo;bright
young man.&rdquo; The name was not forthcoming, and
the victim of a question never asked goes down
nameless to posterity in the Congressional Record
as merely a &ldquo;bright young man.&rdquo; Then General
Grosvenor, a leading Republican of the House, denounced
the commissioner for crediting his district
with an appointee named Rufus Putnam who was
not a resident of the district, and Roosevelt produced
a letter from the general recommending
Rufus Putnam as a resident of his district and a
constituent. All this was unusual. Hitherto it had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
been a safe amusement to ridicule and jeer at civil-service
reform, and here was a commissioner who
dared to reply vigorously to attacks, and even to
prove Senators and Congressmen to be wrong in
their facts. The amusement of baiting the Civil
Service Commission seemed to be less inviting than
before, and, worse still, the entertaining features
seemed to have passed to the public, who enjoyed
and approved the commissioner who disregarded
etiquette and fought hard for the law he was appointed
to enforce. The law suddenly took on new
meaning and became clearly visible in the public
mind, a great service to the cause of good government.</p>

<p>After six years' service in the Civil Service Commission
Roosevelt left Washington to accept the
position of president of the Board of Police Commissioners
of the city of New York, which had been
offered to him by Mayor Strong. It is speaking
within bounds to say that the history of the police
force of New York has been a checkered one in
which the black squares have tended to predominate.
The task which Roosevelt confronted was then,
as always, difficult, and the machinery of four commissioners
and a practically irremovable chief
made action extremely slow and uncertain. Roosevelt
set himself to expel politics and favoritism in
appointments and promotions and to crush corruption
everywhere. In some way he drove through the
obstacles and effected great improvements, although
permanent betterment was perhaps impossible.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Good men were appointed and meritorious men
promoted as never before, while the corrupt and
dangerous officers were punished in a number of
instances sufficient, at least, to check and discourage
evildoers. Discipline was improved, and the
force became very loyal to the chief commissioner,
because they learned to realize that he was fighting
for right and justice without fear or favor. The results
were also shown in the marked decrease of
crime, which judges pointed out from the bench.
Then, too, it was to be observed that a New York
police commissioner suddenly attracted the attention
of the country. The work which was being done
by Roosevelt in New York, his midnight walks
through the worst quarters of the great city, to see
whether the guardians of the peace did their duty,
which made the newspapers compare him to Haroun
Al Raschid, all appealed to the popular imagination.
A purely local office became national in
his hands, and his picture appeared in the shops
of European cities. There was something more
than vigor and picturesqueness necessary to explain
these phenomena. The truth is that Roosevelt
was really laboring through a welter of details
to carry out certain general principles which went
to the very roots of society and government. He
wished the municipal administration to be something
far greater than a business man&rsquo;s administration,
which was the demand that had triumphed at
the polls. He wanted to make it an administration
of the workingmen, of the dwellers in the tenements,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
of the poverty and suffering which haunted
the back streets and hidden purlieus of the huge
city. The people did not formulate these purposes
as they watched what he was doing, but they felt
them and understood them by that instinct which is
often so keen in vast bodies of men. The man who
was toiling in the seeming obscurity of the New
York police commission again became very distinct
to his fellow countrymen and deepened their consciousness
of his existence and their comprehension
of his purposes and aspirations.</p>

<p>Striking as was the effect of this police work, it
only lasted for two years. In 1897 he was offered
by President McKinley, whom he had energetically
supported in the preceding campaign, the position
of Assistant Secretary of the Navy. He accepted at
once, for the place and the work both appealed to
him most strongly. The opportunity did not come
without resistance. The President, an old friend,
liked him and believed in him, but the Secretary
of the Navy had doubts, and also fears that Roosevelt
might be a disturbing and restless assistant.
There were many politicians, too, especially in his
own State, whom his activities as civil-service and
police commissioner did not delight, and these men
opposed him. But his friends were powerful and
devoted, and the President appointed him.</p>

<p>His new place had to him a peculiar attraction.
He loved the Navy. He had written its brilliant
history in the War of 1812. He had done all in his
power in stimulating public opinion to support the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
&ldquo;new Navy&rdquo; we were just then beginning to build.
That war was coming with Spain he had no doubt.
We were unprepared, of course, even for such a
war as this, but Roosevelt set himself to do what
could be done. The best and most farseeing officers
rallied round him, but the opportunities were limited.
There was much in detail accomplished which
can not be described here, but two acts of his which
had very distinct effect upon the fortunes of the
war must be noted. He saw very plainly&mdash;although
most people never perceived it at all&mdash;that the
Philippines would be a vital point in any war with
Spain. For this reason it was highly important to
have the right man in command of the Asiatic
Squadron. Roosevelt was satisfied that Dewey was
the right man, and that his rival was not. He set
to work to secure the place for Dewey. Through
the aid of the Senators from Dewey&rsquo;s native State
and others, he succeeded. Dewey was ordered to
the Asiatic Squadron. Our relations with Spain
grew worse and worse. On February 25, 1898, war
was drawing very near, and that Saturday after-noon
Roosevelt happened to be Acting Secretary,
and sent out the following cablegram:</p>


<div class="tdl" style="margin:1em 10%;"><span class="smcap">Dewey</span>&mdash;Hongkong.</div>

<p style="margin:0 10%;">Order the squadron, except the <i>Monocacy</i>, to Hongkong.
Keep full of coal. In the event of declaration of
war, Spain, your duty will be to see that the Spanish
Squadron does not leave the Asiatic coast, and then offensive
operations in the Philippine Islands. Keep
<i>Olympia</i> until further orders.</p>

<div class="tdr" style="margin:0 10%;"><span class="smcap">Roosevelt.</span></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>I believe he was never again permitted to be Acting
Secretary. But the deed was done. The wise
word of readiness had been spoken and was not recalled.
War came, and as April closed, Dewey, all
prepared, slipped out of Hongkong and on May 1st
fought the battle of Manila Bay.</p>

<p>Roosevelt, however, did not continue long in the
Navy Department. Many of his friends felt that he
was doing such admirable work there that he ought
to remain, but as soon as war was declared he determined
to go, and his resolution was not to be
shaken. Nothing could prevent his fighting for his
country when the country was at war. Congress had
authorized three volunteer regiments of Cavalry,
and the President and the Secretary of War gave to
Leonard Wood&mdash;then a surgeon in the Regular
Army&mdash;as colonel, and to Theodore Roosevelt, as
lieutenant colonel, authority to raise one of these
regiments, known officially as the First United
States Volunteer Cavalry, and to all the country as
the &ldquo;Rough Riders.&rdquo; The regiment was raised
chiefly in the Southwest and West, where Roosevelt&rsquo;s
popularity and reputation among the cowboys
and the ranchmen brought many eager recruits to
serve with him. After the regiment had been organized
and equipped they had some difficulty in
getting to Cuba, but Roosevelt as usual broke
through all obstacles, and finally succeeded, with
Colonel Wood, in getting away with two battalions,
leaving one battalion and the horses behind.</p>

<p>The regiment got into action immediately on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
landing and forced its way, after some sharp fighting
in the jungle, to the high ground on which were
placed the fortifications which defended the approach
to Santiago. Colonel Wood was almost immediately
given command of a brigade, and this
left Roosevelt colonel of the regiment. In the battle
which ensued and which resulted in the capture of
the positions commanding Santiago and the bay,
the Rough Riders took a leading part, storming one
of the San Juan heights, which they christened
Kettle Hill, with Roosevelt leading the men in person.
It was a dashing, gallant assault, well led and
thoroughly successful. Santiago fell after the defeat
of the fleet, and then followed a period of sickness
and suffering&mdash;the latter due to unreadiness&mdash;where
Roosevelt did everything with his usual
driving energy to save his men, whose loyalty to
their colonel went with them through life. The war
was soon over, but brief as it had been Roosevelt
and his men had highly distinguished themselves,
and he stood out in the popular imagination as one
of the conspicuous figures of the conflict. He
brought his regiment back to the United States,
where they were mustered out, and almost immediately
afterwards he was nominated by the Republicans
as their candidate for governor of the State
of New York. The situation in New York was unfavorable
for the Republicans, and the younger
men told Senator Platt, who dominated the organization
and who had no desire for Roosevelt, that
unless he was nominated they could not win. Thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
forced, the organization accepted him, and it was
well for the party that they did so. The campaign
was a sharp one and very doubtful, but Roosevelt
was elected by a narrow margin and assumed office
at the beginning of the new year of 1899. He was
then in his forty-first year.</p>

<p>Many problems faced him and none were evaded.
He was well aware that the &ldquo;organization&rdquo; under
Senator Platt would not like many things he was
sure to do, but he determined that he would have
neither personal quarrels nor faction fights. He
knew, being blessed with strong common sense, that
the Republican Party, his own party, was the instrument
by which alone he could attain his ends,
and he did not intend that it should be blunted and
made useless by internal strife. And yet he meant
to have his own way. It was a difficult role which
he undertook to play, but he succeeded. He had
many differences with the organization managers,
but he declined to lose his temper or to have a
break, and he also refused to yield when he felt he
was standing for the right and a principle was at
stake. Thus he prevailed. He won on the canal
question, changed the insurance commissioner, and
carried the insurance legislation he desired. As in
these cases, so it was in lesser things. In the police
commission he had been strongly impressed by the
dangers as he saw them of the undue and often
sinister influence of business, finance, and great
money interests upon government and politics.
These feelings were deepened and broadened by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
his experience and observation on the larger stage
of State administration. The belief that political
equality must be strengthened and sustained by industrial
equality and a larger economic opportunity
was constantly in his thoughts until it became a
governing and guiding principle.</p>

<p>Meantime he grew steadily stronger among the
people, not only of his own State but of the
country, for he was well known throughout the
West, and there they were watching eagerly to see
how the ranchman and colonel of Rough Riders,
who had touched both their hearts and their imagination,
was faring as governor of New York. The
office he held is always regarded as related to the
Presidency, and this, joined to his striking success
as governor, brought him into the presidential field
wherever men speculated about the political future
It was universally agreed that McKinley was
to be renominated, and so the talk turned to making
Roosevelt Vice President. A friend wrote to him
in the summer of 1899 as to this drift of opinion,
then assuming serious proportions. &ldquo;Do not attempt,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;to thwart the popular desire. You
are not a man nor are your close friends men who
can plan, arrange, and manage you into office. You
must accept the popular wish, whatever it is, follow
your star, and let the future care for itself. It is the
tradition of our politics, and a very poor tradition,
that the Vice Presidency is a shelf. It ought to be,
and there is no reason why it should not be, a stepping-stone.
Put there by the popular desire, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
would be so to you.&rdquo; This view, quite naturally,
did not commend itself to Governor Roosevelt at
the moment. He was doing valuable work in New
York; he was deeply engaged in important reforms
which he had much at heart and which he wished to
carry through; and the Vice Presidency did not attract
him. A year later he was at Philadelphia, a
delegate at large from his State, with his mind unchanged
as to the Vice Presidency, while his New
York friends, anxious to have him continue his
work at Albany, were urging him to refuse. Senator
Platt, for obvious reasons, wished to make him
Vice President, another obstacle to his taking it.
Roosevelt forced the New York delegation to agree
on some one else for Vice President, but he could
not hold the convention, nor could Senator Hanna,
who wisely accepted the situation. Governor Roosevelt
was nominated on the first ballot, all other
candidates withdrawing. He accepted the nomination
little as he liked it.</p>

<p>Thus when it came to the point he instinctively
followed his star and grasped the unvacillating
hand of destiny. Little did he think that destiny
would lead him to the White House through a
tragedy which cut him to the heart. He was on a
mountain in the Adirondacks when a guide made
his way to him across the forest with a telegram
telling him that McKinley, the wise, the kind, the
gentle, with nothing in his heart but good will to
all men, was dying from a wound inflicted by an
anarchist murderer, and that the Vice President
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
must come to Buffalo at once. A rapid night drive
through the woods and a special train brought him
to Buffalo. McKinley was dead before he arrived,
and that evening Governor Roosevelt was sworn in
as President of the United States.</p>

<p>Within the narrow limits of an address it is impossible
to give an account of an administration
of seven years which will occupy hundreds of
pages when the history of the United States during
that period is written. It was a memorable
administration, memorable in itself and not by
the accident of events, and large in its accomplishment
It began with a surprise. There were
persons in the United States who had carefully cultivated
and many people who had accepted without
thought, the idea that Roosevelt was in some way a
dangerous man. They gloomily predicted that there
would be a violent change in the policies and in the
officers of the McKinley administration. But Roosevelt
had not studied the history of his country in
vain. He knew that in three of the four cases where
Vice Presidents had succeeded to the Presidency
through the death of the elected President their
coming had resulted in a violent shifting of policies
and men, and, as a consequence, in most injurious
dissensions, which in two cases at least proved
fatal to the party in power. In all four instances
the final obliteration of the Vice President who had
come into power through the death of his chief was
complete. President Roosevelt did not intend to
permit any of these results. As soon as he came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
into office he announced that he intended to retain
President McKinley&rsquo;s Cabinet and to carry out his
policies, which had been sustained at the polls. To
those overzealous friends who suggested that he
could not trust the appointees of President McKinley
and that he would be but a pallid imitation of
his predecessor he replied that he thought, in any
event, the administration would be his, and that if
new occasions required new policies he felt that he
could meet them, and that no one would suspect
him of being a pallid imitation of anybody. His
decision, however, gratified and satisfied the country
and it was not apparent that Roosevelt was
hampered in any way in carrying out his own policies
by this wise refusal to make sudden and violent
changes.</p>

<p>Those who were alarmed about what he might do
had also suggested that with his combative propensities
he was likely to involve the country in war.
Yet there never has been an administration, as
afterwards appeared, when we were more perfectly
at peace with all the world, nor were our foreign
relations ever in danger of producing hostilities.
But this was not due in the least to the adoption of
a timid or yielding foreign policy; on the contrary,
it was owing to the firmness of the President in all
foreign questions and the knowledge which other
nations soon acquired that President Roosevelt was
a man who never threatened unless he meant to
carry out his threat, the result being that he was not
obliged to threaten at all. One of his earliest successes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
was forcing the settlement of the Alaskan
boundary question, which was the single open question
with Great Britain that was really dangerous
and contained within itself possibilities of war.
The accomplishment of this settlement was followed
later, while Mr. Root was Secretary of State,
by the arrangement of all our outstanding difference
with Canada, and during Mr. Root&rsquo;s tenure
of office over thirty treaties were made with different
nations, including a number of practical and
valuable treaties of arbitration. When Germany
started to take advantage of the difficulties in Venezuela
the affair culminated in the dispatch of
Dewey and the fleet to the Caribbean, the withdrawal
of England at once, and the agreement of
Germany to the reference of all subjects of different
to arbitration. It was President Roosevelt
whose good offices brought Russia and Japan together
in a negotiation which closed the war between
those two powers. It was Roosevelt&rsquo;s
influence which contributed powerfully to settling
the threatening controversy between Germany,
France, and England in regard to Morocco, by the
Algeciras conference. It was Roosevelt who sent
the American fleet of battleships round the world,
one of the most convincing peace movements ever
made on behalf of the United States. Thus it came
about that this President, dreaded at the beginning
on account of his combative spirit, received the
Nobel prize in 1906 as the person who had contribute
most to the peace of the world in the preceding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
years, and his contribution was the result of
strength and knowledge and not of weakness.</p>

<p>At home he recommended to Congress legislation
which was directed toward a larger control of
the railroads and to removing the privileges and
curbing the power of great business combinations
obtained through rebates and preferential freight
rates. This legislation led to opposition in Congress
and to much resistance by those affected. As we
look back, this legislation, so much contested at the
time, seems very moderate, but it was none the less
momentous. President Roosevelt never believed in
Government ownership, but he was thoroughly in
favor of strong and effective Government supervision
and regulation of what are now known generally
as public utilities. He had a deep conviction
that the political influence of financial and business
interests and of great combinations of capital had
become so great that the American people were beginning
to distrust their own Government, than
which there could be no greater peril to the Republic.
By his measures, and by his general attitude
toward capital and labor both, he sought to restore
and maintain the confidence of the people in the
Government they had themselves created.</p>

<p>In the Panama Canal he left the most enduring,
as it was the most visible, monument of his administration
Much criticized at the moment for his
action in regard to it, which time since then has
justified and which history will praise, the great
fact remains that the canal is there. He said him-self
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
that he made up his mind that it was his duty
to establish the canal and have the debate about it
afterwards, which seemed to him better than to
begin with indefinite debate and have no canal at
all. This is a view which posterity both at home
and abroad will accept and approve.</p>

<p>These, passing over as we must in silence many
other beneficent acts, are only a few of the most
salient features of his administration, stripped of
all detail and all enlargement. Despite the conflict
which some of his domestic policies had produce
not only with his political opponents but
within the Republican ranks, he was overwhelmingly
reelected in 1904, and when the seven years
had closed the country gave a like majority to his
chosen successor, taken from his own Cabinet. On
the 4th of March, 1909, he returned to private life
at the age of fifty, having been the youngest President
known to our history.</p>

<p>During the brief vacations which he had been
able to secure in the midst of the intense activities
of his public life after the Spanish War he had
turned for enjoyment to expeditions in pursuit of
big game in the wildest and most unsettled regions
of the country. Open-air life and all its accompaniment
of riding and hunting were to him the one
thing that brought him the most rest and relaxation.
Now, having left the Presidency, he was able to
give full scope to the love of adventure, which had
been strong with him from boyhood. Soon after
his retirement from office he went to Africa, accompanied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
by a scientific expedition sent out by the
Smithsonian Institution. He landed in East Africa,
made his way into the interior, and thence to the
sources of the Nile, after a trip in every way successful
both in exploration and in pursuit of big
game. He then came down the Nile through Egypt
and thence to Europe, and no private citizen of the
United States&mdash;probably no private man of any
country&mdash;was ever received in a manner comparable
to that which met Roosevelt in every country
in Europe which he visited. Everywhere it was
the same&mdash;in Italy, in Germany, in France, in England
Every honor was paid to him that authority
could devise, accompanied by every mark of affection
and admiration which the people of those
countries were able to show. He made few speeches
while in Europe, but in those few he did not fail to
give to the questions and thought of the time real
and genuine contributions, set forth in plain language
always vigorous and often eloquent. He returned
in the summer of 1910 to the United States
and was greeted with a reception on his landing in
New York quite equaling in interest and enthusiasm
that which had been given to him in Europe.</p>

<p>For two years afterwards he devoted himself to
writing, not only articles as contributing editor of
the Outlook, but books of his own, and addresses
and speeches which he was constantly called upon
to make. No man in private life probably ever had
such an audience as he addressed, whether with
tongue or pen, upon the questions of the day, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
a constant refrain as to the qualities necessary to
make men both good citizens and good Americans.
In the spring of 1912 he decided to become a candidate
for the Republican nomination for the residency
and a very heated struggle followed between
himself and President Taft for delegations to
the convention. The convention when it assembled
in Chicago was the stormiest ever known in our history
President Taft was renominated, most of the
Roosevelt delegates refusing to vote, and a large
body of Republicans thereupon formed a new party
called the &ldquo;Progressive&rdquo; and nominated Mr. Roosevelt
as their candidate. This division into two
nearly equal parts of the Republican Party, which
had elected Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Taft in succession
by the largest majorities ever known, made
the victory of the Democratic candidate absolutely
certain. Colonel Roosevelt, however, stood second
in the poll, receiving 4,119,507 votes, carrying six
States and winning eighty-eight electoral votes.
There never has been in political history, when all
conditions are considered, such an exhibition of extraordinary
personal strength. To have secured
eighty-eight electoral votes when his own party was
hopelessly divided, with no great historic party
name and tradition behind him, with an organization
which had to be hastily brought together in a
few weeks, seems almost incredible, and in all his
career there is no display of the strength of his hold
upon the people equal to this.</p>

<p>In the following year he yielded again to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
longing for adventure and exploration. Going to
South America, he made his way up through Paraguay
and western Brazil, and then across a trackless
wilderness of jungle and down an unknown
river into the Valley of the Amazon. It was a remarkable
expedition and carried him through what
is probably the most deadly climate in the world.
He suffered severely from the fever, the poison of
which never left him and which finally shortened
his life.</p>

<p>In the next year the great war began, and Colonel
Roosevelt threw himself into it with all the energy
of his nature. With Major Gardner he led the great
fight for preparedness in a country utterly unprepared
He saw very plainly that in all human
probability it would be impossible for us to keep
out of the war. Therefore in season and out of season
he demanded that we should make ready. He
and Major Gardner, with the others who joined
them, roused a widespread and powerful sentiment
in the country, but there was no practical effect on
the Army. The Navy was the single place where
anything was really done, and that only in the bill
of 1916, so that war finally came upon us as unread
as Roosevelt had feared we should be. Yet
the campaign he made was not in vain, for in addition
to the question of preparation he spoke earnestly
of other things, other burning questions, and
he always spoke to an enormous body of listeners
everywhere. He would have had us protest and
take action at the very beginning, in 1914, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Belgium was invaded. He would have had us go
to war when the murders of the Lusitania were perpetrated
He tried to stir the soul and rouse the
spirit of the American people, and despite every
obstacle he did awaken them, so that when the hour
came, in April, 1917, a large proportion of the
American people were even then ready in spirit
and in hope. How telling his work had been was
proved by the confession of his country&rsquo;s enemies,
for when he died the only discordant note, the only
harsh words, came from the German press. Germany
knew whose voice it was that more powerfully
than any other had called Americans to the
battle in behalf of freedom and civilization, where
the advent of the armies of the United States gave
victory to the cause of justice and righteousness.</p>

<p>When the United States went to war Colonel
Roosevelt&rsquo;s one desire was to be allowed to go to
the fighting line. There if fate had laid its hand
upon him it would have found him glad to fall in
the trenches or in a charge at the head of his men,
but it was not permitted to him to go, and thus he
was denied the reward which he would have ranked
above all others, &ldquo;the great prize of death in battle.&rdquo;
But he was a patriot in every fiber of his
being, and personal disappointment in no manner
slackened or cooled his zeal. Everything that he
could do to forward the war, to quicken preparation
to stimulate patriotism, to urge on efficient
action, was done. Day and night, in season and out
of season, he never ceased his labors. Although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
prevented from going to France himself, he gave
to the great conflict that which was far dearer to
him than his own life. I can not say that he sent
his four sons, because they all went at once, as
everyone knew that their father&rsquo;s sons would go.
Two have been badly wounded; one was killed. He
met the blow with the most splendid and unflinching
courage, met it as Siward, the Earl of Northumberland
receives in the play the news of his
son&rsquo;s death:</p>

<table summary="play">
<tr>
  <td><span class="smcap">Siw.</span></td>
  <td>Had he his hurts before?</td>

<tr>
  <td><span class="smcap">Ross.</span></td>
  <td>Ay, on the front.</td>

<tr>
  <td><span class="smcap">Siw.</span></td>
  <td>Why, then, God&rsquo;s soldier be he!<br />
    Had I as many sons as I have hairs,<br />
    I would not wish them to a fairer death:<br />
    And so his knell is knoll&rsquo;d.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Among the great tragedies of Shakespeare, and
there are none greater in all the literature of man,
<i>Macbeth</i> was Colonel Roosevelt&rsquo;s favorite, and the
moving words which I have just quoted I am sure
were in his heart and on his lips when he faced
with stern resolve and self-control the anguish
brought to him by the death of his youngest boy,
killed in the glory of a brave and brilliant youth.</p>

<p>He lived to see the right prevail; he lived to see
civilization triumph over organized barbarism;
and there was great joy in his heart. In all his last
days the thoughts which filled his mind were to
secure a peace which should render Germany forever
harmless and advance the cause of ordered
freedom in every land and among every race. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
occupied him to the exclusion of everything else,
except what he called and what we like to call
Americanism. There was no hour down to the end
when he would not turn aside from everything else
to preach the doctrine of Americanism, of the
principles and the faith upon which American
government rested, and which all true Americans
should wear in their heart of hearts. He was a
great patriot, a great man; above all, a great
American. His country was the ruling, mastering
passion of his life from the beginning even unto
the end.</p>

<p>So closes the inadequate, most incomplete account
of a life full of work done and crowded with
achievement, brief in years and prematurely
ended. The recitation of the offices which he held
and of some of the deeds that he did is but a
bare, imperfect catalogue into which history when
we are gone will breathe a lasting life. Here to-day
it is only a background, and that which most concern
us now is what the man was of whose deeds
done it is possible to make such a list. What a man
was is ever more important than what he did, because
it is upon what he was that all his achievement
depends and his value and meaning to his
fellow men must finally rest.</p>

<p>Theodore Roosevelt always believed that character
was of greater worth and moment than anything
else. He possessed abilities of the first order,
which he was disposed to underrate, because he set
so much greater store upon the moral qualities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
which we bring together under the single word
&ldquo;character.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let me speak first of his abilities. He had a
powerful, well-trained, ever-active mind. He
thought clearly, independently, and with originality
and imagination. These priceless gifts were
sustained by an extraordinary power of acquisition
joined to a greater quickness of apprehension,
a greater swiftness in seizing upon the essence of
a question, than I have ever happened to see in
any other man. His reading began with natural
history, then went to general history, and thence
to the whole field of literature. He had a capacity
for concentration which enabled him to read with
remarkable rapidity anything which he took up,
if only for a moment, and which separated him
for the time being from everything going on about
him. The subjects upon which he was well and
widely informed would, if enumerated, fill a large
space, and to this power of acquisition was united
not only a tenacious but an extraordinarily accurate
memory. It was never safe to contest with him
on any question of fact or figures, whether they relate
to the ancient Assyrians or to the present-day
conditions of the tribes of central Africa, to the
Syracusan Expedition, as told by Thucydides, or
to protective coloring in birds and animals. He
knew and held details always at command, but
he was not mastered by them. He never failed to
see the forest on account of the trees, or the city
on account of the houses.</p>

<p>He made himself a writer, not only of occasional
addresses and essays, but of books. He had the
trained thoroughness of the historian, as he showed
in his history of the War of 1812 and of the <i>Winning
of the West</i>, and nature had endowed him with
that most enviable of gifts, the faculty of narrative
and the art of the teller of tales. He knew
how to weigh evidence in the historical scales and
how to depict character. He learned to write with
great ease and fluency. He was always vigorous,
always energetic, always clear and forcible in
everything he wrote&mdash;nobody could ever misunderstand
him&mdash;and when he allowed himself time
and his feelings were deeply engaged he gave to
the world many pages of beauty as well as power,
not only in thought but in form and style. At the
same time he made himself a public speaker, and
here again, through a practice probably unequaled
in amount, he became one of the most effective in
all our history. In speaking, as in writing, he was
always full of force and energy; he drove home
his arguments and never was misunderstood. In
many of his more carefully prepared addresses
are to be found passages of impressive eloquence,
touched with imagination and instinct with grace
and feeling.</p>

<p>He had a large capacity for administration,
clearness of vision, promptness in decision, and a
thorough apprehension of what constituted efficient
organization. All the vast and varied work which
he accomplished could not have been done unless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
he had had most exceptional natural abilities, but
behind them, most important of all, was the driving
force of an intense energy and the ever-present
belief that a man could do what he willed to do.
As he made himself an athlete, a horseman, a good
shot, a bold explorer, so he made himself an exceptionally
successful writer and speaker. Only a
most abnormal energy would have enabled him to
enter and conquer in so many fields of intellectual
achievement. But something more than energy
and determination is needed for the largest success
especially in the world&rsquo;s high places. The
first requisite of leadership is ability to lead, and
that ability Theodore Roosevelt possessed in full
measure. Whether in a game or in the hunting
field, in a fight or in politics, he sought the front,
where, as Webster once remarked, there is always
plenty of room for those who can get there. His instinct
was always to say &ldquo;come&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;go,&rdquo;
and he had the talent of command.</p>

<p>His also was the rare gift of arresting attention
sharply and suddenly, a very precious attribute,
and one easier to illustrate than to describe. This
arresting power is like a common experience, which
we have all had on entering a picture gallery, of
seeing at once and before all others a single picture
among the many on the walls. For a moment you
see nothing else, although you may be surrounded
with masterpieces. In that particular picture lurks
a strange, capturing, gripping fascination as impalpable
as it is unmistakable. Roosevelt had this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
same arresting, fascinating quality. Whether in
the legislature at Albany, the Civil Service omission
at Washington, or the police commission in
New York, whether in the Spanish War or on the
plains among the cowboys, he was always vivid, at
times startling, never to be overlooked. Nor did
this power stop here. He not only without effort
or intention drew the eager attention of the people
to himself, he could also engage and fix their
thoughts upon anything which happened to interest
him. It might be a man or a book, reformed spelling
or some large historical question, his traveling
library or the military preparation of the United
States, he had but to say, &ldquo;See how interesting,
how important, is this man or this event!&rdquo; and
thousands, even millions, of people would reply,
&ldquo;We never thought of this before, but it certainly
is one of the most interesting, most absorbing
things in the world.&rdquo; He touched a subject and it
suddenly began to glow as when the high-power
electric current touches the metal and the white
light starts forth and dazzles the onlooking eyes.
We know the air played by the Pied Piper of
Hamlin no better than we know why Theodore
Roosevelt thus drew the interest of men after him.
We only know they followed wherever his insatiable
activity of mind invited them.</p>

<p>Men follow also most readily a leader who is
always there before them, clearly visible and just
where they expect him. They are especially eager
to go forward with a man who never sounds a retreat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Roosevelt was always advancing, always
struggling to make things better, to carry some
much-needed reform, and help humanity to a
larger chance, to a fairer condition, to a happier
life. Moreover, he looked always for an ethical
question. He was at his best when he was fighting
me battle of right against wrong. He thought
soundly and wisely upon questions of expediency
or of political economy, but they did not rouse
him or bring him the absorbed interest of the eternal
conflict between good and evil. Yet he was
never impractical, never blinded by counsels of
perfection, never seeking to make the better the
enemy of the good. He wished to get the best,
but he would strive for all that was possible even
if it fell short of the highest at which he aimed.
He studied the lessons of history, and did not think
the past bad simply because it was the past, or
the new good solely because it was new. He sought
to try all questions on their intrinsic merits, and
that was why he succeeded in advancing, in making
government and society better, where others, who
would be content with nothing less than an abstract
perfection, failed. He would never compromise
a principle, but he was eminently tolerant of honest
differences of opinion. He never hesitated to give
generous credit where credit seemed due, whether
to friend or opponent, and in this way he gathered
recruits and yet never lost adherents.</p>

<p>The criticism most commonly made upon Theodore
Roosevelt was that he was impulsive and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
impetuous; that he acted without thinking. He
would have been the last to claim infallibility. His
head did not turn when fame came to him and
choruses of admiration sounded in his ears, for he
was neither vain nor credulous. He knew that he
made mistakes, and never hesitated to admit them
to be mistakes and to correct them or put them
behind him when satisfied that they were such. But
he wasted no time in mourning, explaining, or
vainly regretting them. It is also true that the middle
way did not attract him. He was apt to go far,
both in praise and censure, although nobody could
analyze qualities and balance them justly in judging
men better than he. He felt strongly, and as he
had no concealments of any kind, he expressed
himself in like manner. But vehemence is not violence
nor is earnestness anger, which a very wise
man defined as a brief madness. It was all according
to his nature, just as his eager cordiality in
meeting men and women, his keen interest in other
people&rsquo;s care or joys, was not assumed, as some
persons thought who did not know him. It was all
profoundly natural, it was all real, and in that
way and in no other was he able to meet and greet
his fellow men. He spoke out with the most unrestrained
frankness at all times and in all companies
Not a day passed in the Presidency when
he was not guilty of what the trained diplomatist
would call indiscretions. But the frankness had its
own reward. There never was a President whose
confidence was so respected or with whom the barriers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of honor which surround private conversation
were more scrupulously observed. At the same
time, when the public interest required, no man
could be more wisely reticent. He was apt, it is
true, to act suddenly and decisively, but it was a
complete mistake to suppose that he therefore acted
without thought or merely on a momentary impulse
When he had made up his mind he was
resolute and unchanging, but he made up his mind
only after much reflection, and there never was a
President in the White House who consulted not
only friends but political opponents and men of all
kinds and conditions more than Theodore Roosevelt
When he had reached his conclusion he acted
quickly and drove hard at his object, and this it
was, probably, which gave an impression that he
acted sometimes hastily and thoughtlessly, which
was a complete misapprehension of the man. His
action was emphatic, but emphasis implies reflection
not thoughtlessness. One can not even emphasize
a word without a process, however slight, of
mental differentiation.</p>

<p>The feeling that he was impetuous and impulsive
was also due to the fact that in a sudden, seemingly
unexpected crisis he would act with great
rapidity. This happened when he had been for
weeks, perhaps for months, considering what he
should do if such a crisis arose. He always believe
that one of the most important elements of
success, whether in public or in private life, was
to know what one meant to do under given circumstances.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
If he saw the possibility of perilous
questions arising, it was his practice to think over
carefully just how he would act under certain contingencies
Many of the contingencies never arose.
Now and then a contingency became an actuality,
and then he was ready. He knew what he meant to
do, he acted at once, and some critics considered
him impetuous, impulsive, and, therefore, dangerous
because they did not know that he had thought
the question all out beforehand.</p>

<p>Very many people, powerful elements in the
community, regarded him at one time as a dangerous
radical, bent upon overthrowing all the safe-guard
of society and planning to tear out the
foundations of an ordered liberty. As a matter of
fact, what Theodore Roosevelt was trying to do
was to strengthen American society and American
Government by demonstrating to the American people
that he was aiming at a larger economic equality
and a more generous industrial opportunity for
all men, and that any combination of capital or of
business, which threatened the control of the Government
by the people who made it, was to be
curbed and resisted, just as he would have resisted
an enemy who tried to take possession of the city of
Washington. He had no hostility to a man because
he had been successful in business or because he
had accumulated a fortune. If the man had been
honestly successful and used his fortune wisely and
beneficently, he was regarded by Theodore Roosevelt
as a good citizen. The vulgar hatred of wealth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
found no place in his heart. He had but one standard
one test, and that was whether a man, rich
or poor, was an honest man, a good citizen, and a
good American. He tried men, whether they were
men of &ldquo;big business&rdquo; or members of a labor
union, by their deeds, and in no other way. The
tyranny of anarchy and disorder, such as is now
desolating Russia, was as hateful to him as any
other tyranny, whether it came from an autocratic
system like that of Germany or from the misuse of
organized capital. Personally he believed in every
man earning his own living, and he earned money
and was glad to do so; but he had no desire or taste
for making money, and he was entirely indifferent
to it. The simplest of men in his own habits, the
only thing he really would have liked to have done
with ample wealth would have been to give freely
to the many good objects which continually interested
him.</p>

<p>Theodore Roosevelt&rsquo;s power, however, and the
main source of all his achievement, was not in the
offices which he held, for those offices were to him
only opportunities, but in the extraordinary hold
which he established and retained over great bodies
of men. He had the largest personal following ever
attained by any man in our history. I do not mean
by this the following which comes from great political
office or from party candidacy. There have
been many men who have held the highest offices
in our history by the votes of their fellow country-me
who have never had anything more than a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
small personal following. By personal following is
meant here that which supports and sustains and
goes with a man simply because he is himself; a
following which does not care whether their leader
and chief is in office or out of office, which is with
him and behind him because they, one and all, believe
in him and love him and are ready to stand
by him for the sole and simple reason that they
have perfect faith that he will lead them where they
wish and where they ought to go. This following
Theodore Roosevelt had, as I have said, in a larger
degree than anyone in our history, and the fact
that he had it and what he did with it for the welfare
of his fellow men have given him his great
place and his lasting fame.</p>

<p>This is not mere assertion; it was demonstrated,
as I have already pointed out, by the vote of 1912,
and at all times, from the day of his accession to
the Presidency onward, there were millions of people
in this country ready to follow Theodore Roosevelt
and vote for him, or do anything else that he
wanted, whenever he demanded their support or
raised his standard. It was this great mass of support
among the people, and which probably was
never larger than in these last years, that gave him
his immense influence upon public opinion, and
public opinion was the weapon which he used to
carry out all the policies which he wished to bring
to fulfillment and to consolidate all the achievement
upon which he had set his heart. This extraordinary
popular strength was not given to him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
solely because the people knew him to be honest
and brave, because they were certain that physical
fear was an emotion unknown to him, and that his
moral courage equaled the physical. It was not
merely because they thoroughly believed him to be
sincere. All this knowledge and belief, of course,
went to making his popular leadership secure; but
there was much more in it than that, something
that went deeper, basic elements which were not
upon the surface which were due to qualities of
temperament interwoven with his very being, inseparable
from him and yet subtle rather than obvious
in their effects.</p>

<p>All men admire courage, and that he possessed
in the highest degree. But he had also something
larger and rarer than courage, in the ordinary acceptation
of the word. When an assassin shot him
at Milwaukee he was severely wounded; how severely
he could not tell, but it might well have
been mortal. He went on to the great meeting
awaiting him and there, bleeding, suffering, ignorant
of his fate, but still unconquered, made his
speech and went from the stage to the hospital.
What bore him up was the dauntless spirit which
could rise victorious over pain and darkness and
the unknown and meet the duty of the hour as if
all were well. A spirit like this awakens in all men
more than admiration, it kindles affection and appeal
to every generous impulse.</p>

<p>Very different, but equally compelling, was another
quality. There is nothing in human beings at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
once so sane and so sympathetic as a sense of
humor. This great gift the good fairies conferred
upon Theodore Roosevelt at his birth in unstinted
measure. No man ever had a more abundant sense
of humor&mdash;joyous, irrepressible humor&mdash;and it
never deserted him. Even at the most serious and
even perilous moments if there was a gleam of humor
anywhere he saw it and rejoiced and helped
himself with it over the rough places and in the
dark hour. He loved fun, loved to joke and chaff,
and, what is more uncommon, greatly enjoyed being
chaffed himself. His ready smile and contagious
laugh made countless friends and saved him from
many an enmity. Even more generally effective
than his humor, and yet allied to it, was the universal
knowledge that Roosevelt had no secrets
from the American people.</p>

<p>Yet another quality&mdash;perhaps the most engaging
of all&mdash;was his homely, generous humanity which
enabled him to speak directly to the primitive instinct
of man.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He dwelt with the tribes of the marsh and moor,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He sate at the board of kings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He tasted the toil of the burdened slave<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the joy that triumph brings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But whether to jungle or palace hall<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or white-walled tent he came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was brother to king and soldier and slave<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His welcome was the same.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He was very human and intensely American, and
this knit a bond between him and the American
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
people which nothing could ever break. And then
he had yet one more attraction, not so impressive,
perhaps, as the others, but none the less very important
and very captivating. He never by any
chance bored the American people. They might
laugh at him or laugh with him, they might like
what he said or dislike it, they might agree with
him or disagree with him, but they were never
wearied of him, and he never failed to interest
them. He was never heavy, laborious, or dull. If
he had made any effort to be always interesting
and entertaining he would have failed and been
tiresome. He was unfailingly attractive, because
he was always perfectly natural and his own unconscious
self. And so all these things combined to
give him his hold upon the American people, not
only upon their minds, but upon their hearts and
their instincts, which nothing could ever weaken,
and which made him one of the most remarkable,
as he was one of the strongest, characters that the
history of popular government can show. He was
also&mdash;and this is very revealing and explanatory,
too, of his vast popularity&mdash;a man of ideals. He
did not expose them daily on the roadside with language
fluttering about them like the Thibetan who
ties his slip of paper to the prayer wheel whirling
in the wind. He kept his ideals to himself until the
hour of fulfillment arrived. Some of them were the
dreams of boyhood, from which he never departed,
and which I have seen him carry out shyly and yet
thoroughly and with intense personal satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>He had a touch of the knight errant in his daily
life, although he would never have admitted it; but
it was there. It was not visible in the medieval
form of shining armor and dazzling tournaments,
but in the never-ceasing effort to help the poor and
the oppressed, to defend and protect women and
children, to right the wronged and succor the downtrodden
Passing by on the other side was not a
mode of travel through life ever possible to him;
and yet he was as far distant from the professional
philanthropist as could well be imagined, for all
he tried to do to help his fellow men he regarded
as part of the day&rsquo;s work to be done and not talked
about. No man ever prized sentiment or hated sentimentality
more than he. He preached unceasingly
the familiar morals which lie at the bottom
of both family and public life. The blood of some
ancestral Scotch covenanter or of some Dutch reformed
preacher facing the tyranny of Philip of
Spain was in his veins, and with his large opportunities
and his vast audiences he was always ready
to appeal for justice and righteousness. But his
own personal ideals he never attempted to thrust
upon the world until the day came when they were
to be translated into realities of action.</p>

<p>When the future historian traces Theodore Roosevelt&rsquo;s
extraordinary career he will find these embodied
ideals planted like milestones along the
road over which he marched. They never left him.
His ideal of public service was to be found in his
life, and as his life drew to its close he had to meet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
his ideal of sacrifice face to face. All his sons went
from him to the war, and one was killed upon the
field of honor. Of all the ideals that lift men up,
the hardest to fulfill is the ideal of sacrifice. Theodore
Roosevelt met it as he had all others and fulfilled
it to the last jot of its terrible demands. His
country asked the sacrifice and he gave it with
solemn pride and uncomplaining lips.</p>

<p>This is not the place to speak of his private life,
but within that sacred circle no man was ever more
blessed in the utter devotion of a noble wife and
the passionate love of his children. The absolute
purity and beauty of his family life tell us why
the pride and interest which his fellow countrymen
felt in him were always touched with the warm
light of love. In the home so dear to him, in his
sleep, death came, and&mdash;</p>

<p>So Valiant-for-Truth passed over and all the trumpets
sounded for him on the other side.</p>
